# Obsidian Timecodes Plugin

Turns raw timecodes (`MM:SS`/`HH:MM:SS`) into clickable links in reading mode.

Detects YouTube links of the following forms:

- raw text links: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`
- markdown links: `[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...)`
- videos embedded into Obsidian note with `<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/...`
